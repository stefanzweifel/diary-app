# Diary App

## About

This is an example app to showcase how you can use End-to-End Encryption in your Laravel Apps. I've used Vue as the Frontend Framework but the code should be easily portable to any Framework of your choice.

I've written a blog post about the project. You can read it [here](https://stefanzweifel.io/posts/code-experiment-end-to-end-encrypted-diary-app).
